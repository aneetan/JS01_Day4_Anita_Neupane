        // A language which is associated with run time values and variable changes
        // its type dynamically is called dynamically typed language.

        // JavaScript is a dynamically typed language because the variables have no types and they change
        // type dynamically. If js is executed on google chrome, its runtime is v8. so it can be termed as
